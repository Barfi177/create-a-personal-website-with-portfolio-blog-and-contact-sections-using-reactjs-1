# My Portfolio (React)

This is a Create React App scaffold for a personal website (Home, Portfolio, Blog, Contact). It's configured to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

Before you push:
- Replace homepage in package.json with your GitHub pages URL:
  "homepage": "https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>"

How to publish
1. Create a repository on GitHub (or use gh CLI).
2. Locally:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
   git push -u origin main

3. The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) will run on push to `main`, build the app, and deploy the `build` folder to GitHub Pages automatically.

Notes
- If you prefer Vercel (recommended for React apps), skip the homepage change â€” just push the repo to GitHub and import on Vercel. Vercel will auto-deploy on each push.
- To use the contact form, replace the Formspree action URL with your Formspree endpoint or your own backend.
- Add images in public/images/ and update data/projects.js accordingly.

If you want, I can:
- Create a ready-to-import GitHub repo (you'll still have to push it under your account)
- Convert the workflow to deploy to Netlify or Vercel
